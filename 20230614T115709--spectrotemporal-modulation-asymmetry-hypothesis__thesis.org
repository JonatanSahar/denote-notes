This theory argues that the left hemisphere is capable of integrating a wide range of
temporal modulations, ranging from slow to fast, but has a limited ability to integrate
high spectral modulations. In contrast, its right homolog can integrate a wide range of
spectral modulations, ranging from low to high, but only slow temporal modulations
(Flinker et al., 2019; Figure 1A).
It explains the fact that [[denote:20230614T114916][auditory cortex responses are laterlized based on the type of salient acoustic features]].
