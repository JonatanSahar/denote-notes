* Prompt:
Humans are assumed to predict the sensory consequences of their own actions by means of forward models that enable discrimination between self-produced and external sensory signals. Here we tested whether responses in the human auditory cortex would differ to self-triggered versus externally triggered tones. The responses were recorded with a whole-scalp neuromagnetometer from 12 healthy subjects who either themselves triggered a tone by pressing a button once every 5 s or passively listened to externally triggered tones, presented in an identical sound sequence. Sources of the auditory N100m responses, peaking ~90 ms after sound onset in the supratemporal auditory cortex, were significantly weaker to self-triggered than to externally triggered sounds (suppressions 24 6 7% and 18 6 4% in the left and right hemispheres, respectively). These results support the existence of a forward model that predicts the auditory consequences of the subject’s own motor acts on the environment — even with a tool — and thereby enables discrimination between self-produced and external sounds.

Motor-induced Suppression of the Auditory Cortex Aliu, 2009

This paper discusses motor-induced suppression (MIS) of sensory cortical feedback and characterizes its properties through three MEG experiments in the auditory system. The results suggest that MIS is sensitive to delays between the motor act and stimulus onset and may have implications for the suppression of self-produced speech. The paper provides insights into the mechanisms of sensory motor processing and control.


A cerebellum-like circuit in the auditory system cancels responses to self-generated sounds Singla, 2017

This paper is about understanding how the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) contributes to early auditory processing. The researchers found that DCN neurons are largely unaffected by self-generated sounds and exhibit gradual reductions in their responses to acoustic stimuli that are temporally correlated with licking. This suggests that DCN may act as an adaptive filter for cancelling self-generated sounds, which has been established previously for cerebellum-like sensory structures in fish. This study is important because it provides new insights into how the DCN contributes to auditory processing and could have implications for understanding hearing disorders.



Self-generation and sound intensity interactively modulate perceptual bias, but not perceptual sensitivity. Paraskevoudi, 2021

The paper examines how the context of self- or externally-generated stimuli, as well as stimulus intensity, can modulate perceptual processing. The study found that self-generation did not affect detection or discrimination sensitivity, but there was a significant interaction between self-generation and intensity on perceptual bias. Supra-threshold self-generated sounds were perceived softer, while near-threshold self-generated sounds were perceived louder. This suggests that perception is modulated by a biased estimate of perceived loudness rather than changes in detection and discrimination sensitivity. This research is important because it provides empirical support for recent theories on how predictions and signal intensity can influence perceptual processing.

Incidental or Intentional? Different Brain Responses to One's Own Action Sounds in Hurdling vs. Tap Dancing. Heins, 2020

This paper investigates whether there is a difference in neural representation and impact on performance evaluation between intentional and incidental action sounds. The study compares tap dancing (intentional action sound) and hurdling (incidental action sound) and examines whether observation of these actions leads to stronger attenuation in primary auditory cortex and a stronger mismatch signal when sounds do not match our expectations. The findings suggest that the processing of self-generated action sounds depends on whether we have the intention to produce a sound with our action or not, and action sounds may be more prone to be used as sensory feedback when they are part of the explicit action goal. This research is important for a better understanding of the function of action sounds for learning and controlling sound-producing actions.



Cancelling cancellation? Sensorimotor control, agency, and prediction
Press, 2023

This paper discusses recent research that challenges the idea of predictive cancellation in classic theories of action control and awareness. The authors argue that while this may require a rethinking of how predictions shape perception, the wider pyramid of ideas related to action control and agentic experiences can remain largely intact. This is important because it helps us to understand how agents optimize their interactions with the external world, even if predictive cancellation is cancelled from theory.


Sensory suppression and increased neuromodulation during actions disrupt memory encoding of unpredictable self-initiated stimuli
Paraskevoudi, 2022

This paper investigates how actions modulate sensory processing and memory encoding of unpredictable sounds, using EEG and pupil recordings. The results show that sensory attenuation and neuromodulatory processes coexist during actions, and both relate to disrupted memory for concurrent sounds. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the integration of motor and sensory information, and have potential implications for understanding how action influences perception and memory.


Attenuation of Responses to Self-Generated Sounds in Auditory Cortical Neurons

The paper is about the cellular basis underlying attenuated responses to self-generated sounds in mice, which helps us understand how organisms distinguish self-generated from externally generated sensory input and how predictive processes contribute to this effect. The study shows for the first time that responses of auditory cortical neurons are attenuated to sounds generated manually by the animals' own behavior, and that this effect is distinct from the nonspecific effect of behavioral activity on auditory responsiveness. This research is important because it provides insights into the fundamental problem for behaving organisms in distinguishing self-generated from externally generated sensory input and offers a foundation for studying impairments in the processing of self-generated sounds observed in psychiatric illness and animal disease models.


The self in action effects: Selective attenuation of self-generated sounds

This paper is about testing the assumption that the internal motor signals associated with self-generated actions lead to attenuation of the sensory consequences of one's own actions, which allows them to be classified as self-generated. The researchers compared sensory attenuation of self-generated and observed sensory effects and found that the perception of sounds that were self-generated had a special perceptual quality which distinguishes it from any sort of external influence. They suggest that a real sense of self-agency is not a socially shared but rather a unique and private experience.


Motor planning modulates neural activity patterns in early human auditory cortex. Gale, 2019

This paper presents two human functional MRI studies that explore how movement planning modulates early sensory cortical areas in anticipation of upcoming behaviours. The authors find that motor-related information can be decoded from neural activity patterns in early auditory cortex well before movement, and that the representation of effector-specific information in auditory cortex, like that in the motor system, is contralateral in nature. These findings suggest that action planning involves the modulation of primary sensory areas, preparing them for the processing of sensory information that arises during the unfolding action.

Action-associated modulation of visual event-related potentials evoked by abstract and ecological stimuli. Csifcsák, 2019

This paper is about the influence of action-associated predictive processes on visual ERPs and whether there is evidence for sensory attenuation (SA) indexed by ERP amplitude reductions for self-induced stimuli when compared to passive viewing of the same images. The authors also assessed if SA is present for both ecological and abstract stimuli, modulated by the degree of stimulus predictability, and sensitive to laterality of hand movements. The findings suggest that movement-related predictive processes attenuate early visual responses, and amplitude modulations in the P1 time range reflect the interaction between expectation-based SA and attention-associated amplitude enhancements. The authors note potential implications for assessing the influence of action-associated predictions on visual processing in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia.


The encoding of stochastic regularities is facilitated by action-effect predictions. Korka, 2021

In the study, participants were asked to produce random sequences of high and low pitch sounds by button presses in two different conditions. In one condition, one button produced high pitch sounds and the other produced low pitch sounds, while in the other condition, both buttons randomly produced high or low pitch sounds. Rare medium pitch deviants were presented, and the results showed that the specific condition elicited larger mismatch negativity (MMN) and N2 responses compared to the unspecific condition, despite equal sound probabilities. This indicates that action-effect predictions can enhance stochastic regularity-based predictions and engage higher-order deviance detection processes, which further extends our understanding of the role of action predictions at sensory levels.
