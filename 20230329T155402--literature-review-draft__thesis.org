*** I. Introduction
- Background: Explain the importance of auditory-motor interactions and how they play a crucial role in our ability to perceive and generate actions that create auditory consequences.
- Significance of studying the effect of hand-ear laterality on auditory processing: Discuss the potential implications of this research for understanding auditory-motor integration mechanisms, and how it could contribute to our knowledge of hemispheric lateralization and multisensory integration.
- Perception and processing of self-generated stimuli:
    + key findings relating to the differences from externally generated stimuli
    + key findings relating to affector/effector laterality and affector/cortex laterality

*** II. Auditory-motor interactions
- Theoretical models: Discuss the different theoretical models proposed to explain the interactions between the auditory and motor systems. For example, predictive coding, efference copy, and the mirror neuron system.
- Empirical evidence: Summarize key empirical findings about the role of the motor cortex in modulating auditory processing, and how motor information can influence auditory perception and vice versa. Provide examples of studies that have used different methods to explore these interactions, such as neuroimaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and behavioral experiments.

*** III. Hand-ear laterality and its impact on auditory processing
- Definition of laterality: Define what is meant by the terms contralateral and ipsilateral, and explain how they relate to auditory-motor interactions.
- Literature review of studies examining the effects of laterality: Summarize findings from previous studies that have investigated the impact of hand-ear laterality on auditory processing. Include studies that have investigated both contralateral and ipsilateral configurations. Provide an overview of the different methods used to measure auditory processing, such as pure-tone audiometry, speech perception tests, and electrophysiological recordings.
- Evidence for and against the existence of contralateral and ipsilateral differences: Discuss the evidence both for and against the idea that contralateral and ipsilateral configurations may lead to different patterns of auditory-motor interactions. For example, some studies have reported that auditory-motor interactions are stronger when the ear and hand are on the same side, while others have found no difference between contralateral and ipsilateral configurations. Include results pertaining to audiomotor learning.

*** IV. Conclusion
- Summary: Briefly summarize the key points discussed in the literature review, including the theoretical and empirical work on auditory-motor interactions, and the evidence for and against the impact of hand-ear laterality on these interactions.
- Gaps and limitations: Discuss any gaps or limitations in the current understanding of these issues, and suggest areas for future research. For example, it may be important to investigate whether the effects of laterality on auditory-motor interactions vary depending on the type of auditory stimulus or motor action being performed.
- Relevance to current research: Explain why this literature review is relevant to the current study, and how it informs the research question and hypotheses being tested.
