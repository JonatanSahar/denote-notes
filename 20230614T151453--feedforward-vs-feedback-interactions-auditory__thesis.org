Feedforward interactions often involve/rely on prediction. These are situations where motor action is modulated or planned so as to match a desired sensory effect. For example - tapping your foot to the beat.
Feedback interactions are those where reafferent auditory feedback guides alterations and adjustments in motor actions.
