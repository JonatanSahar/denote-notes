Presents a lower discrimination (visual, gabors) for self-generated stimuli + a suggested mechanism

* reading notes
they suggest a mechanism to support the ideas of [[denote:20230619T104021][Theory of event coding (TEC)]] in modeling attenuation: proposing that voluntary action preactivates previously learned actionâ€“effects.
they review results from Cardoso-Leite et al. (2010) which show that for self generated visual stimuli (low contrast gabors) there is a greater overlap between the signal and noise distributions (d', signal detection theory).
