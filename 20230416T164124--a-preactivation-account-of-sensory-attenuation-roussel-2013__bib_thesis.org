* reading notes
they suggest a new model of attenuation: proposing that voluntary action preactivates previously learned actionâ€“effects.
they review results from Cardoso-Leite et al. (2010) which show that for self generated visual stimuli (low contrast gabors) there is a greater overlap between the signal and noise distributions (d', signal detection theory).
in reference to the TOC ([cite:@hommelTheoryEventCoding2019a]) they say that since actions and their sensory consequences share an underlying neural code, then the execution of an action constitutes a preactivation of the sensory circuit that will experience it.
