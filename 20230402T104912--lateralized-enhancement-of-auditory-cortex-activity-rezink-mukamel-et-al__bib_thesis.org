This paper investigates how the brain processes self-generated sounds compared to externally generated sounds.
The study found that self-generated sounds enhance activity in the auditory cortex and increase perceptual sensitivity in a lateralized manner. The enhancement in the auditory cortex was stronger when the sound-producing hand was contralateral to the auditory cortex, suggesting a lateralized effect.

 The subjects were asked to perform a task where they either produced a sound themselves or heard an externally generated sound while their brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
