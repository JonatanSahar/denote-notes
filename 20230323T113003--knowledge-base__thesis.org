This review article focuses on the sensory processing of action effects and how it differs from the processing of externally triggered stimuli. The article discusses intentional binding and sensory attenuation and their attribution to forward action models. The review systematically investigates the role of temporal prediction, temporal control, identity prediction, and motor prediction in previous reports of sensory attenuation and intentional binding. The authors propose avenues for future research to better understand the role of motor prediction in processing voluntary action effects and how these phenomena fit within a general predictive processing framework. The article also highlights the implications of this research for understanding disorders of agency in schizophrenia.

  this paper shows that even low-level subcortical processing is affected by high-level predictions - embodied here as predictions which must be based on abstract rules rather than local statistics of the sound stimulus
- figures:

The study discussed above aimed to understand sensory processing mechanisms in the auditory midbrain (IC) and auditory thalamus (MGB) by testing two contrasting theories: habituation to local stimulus statistics and predictive coding. For this investigation, the researchers employed a novel experimental design and utilized ultra-high-resolution 7-Tesla fMRI scans optimized for imaging the IC and MGB.

The main findings from this study were:

1. The BOLD (blood-oxygen-level-dependent) responses in the IC and MGB were found to be correlated with the subjects’ expectations about the probability of stimulus occurrence, rather than with the local stimulus statistics.

2. Deviations from local stimulus statistics did not result in increased responses in IC and MGB if the subjects expected these deviations.

3. A Bayesian model comparison revealed that the predictive coding model best explained the responses in most of the voxels in the IC and MGB.

The study showed that sensory processing in the auditory midbrain and thalamus is mainly driven by the expectations of the subject and not by the regularities in the local stimulus statistics. This indicates that predictive coding is the dominant mechanism for processing sensory information in these regions.

Furthermore, the results suggest that expectations based on abstract rules, as opposed to just local stimulus statistics, are likely used in other sensory modalities as well. This contributes to the optimization of sensory systems and maximization of information transmission.

The significance of these findings lies in the understanding of predictive coding as an essential aspect of sensory processing. This is especially important considering that atypical predictive coding in subcortical sensory pathways could have cognitive implications. For instance, individuals with developmental dyslexia, who often face challenges in processing speech sounds, have been found to have altered adaption dynamics to stimulus regularities and altered responses in MGB. Therefore, an understanding of these mechanisms could be invaluable in clinical contexts, particularly in developing strategies for intervention and management of conditions such as dyslexia.* Action modulates perception

Cardoso-Leite et al. (2010) found that the perception of visual action effects was impaired when the effects were triggered by an action that habitually produced them.
    • The experiment presented in this article aimed to determine whether learned sensorimotor contingencies truly affect perception, rather than just inducing a response bias.
    • During the association phase of the experiment, specific actions (left-key and right-key presses) were associated with specific visual effects (tilted Gabor patches).
    • In the test phase, participants' left-key presses and right-key presses triggered an onset of low contrast tilted Gabor patch on 50% trials while no stimulus was present for remaining 50%.
    • Results showed that sensitivity(d') to these gabors decreased by 10%, indicating that action does not induce any response bias but changes perception instead.

The study by Hughes and Waszak (2011) found that visual stimuli that were triggered by an action were associated with a reduction in the frontoparietal network of ERP components around 150ms after stimulus onset.
    • The study aimed to explore the physiological measures of sensory attenuation and action effect prediction in visual domain.
    • The task used in the study was a paradigm where voluntary actions were either associated with a visual action effect or to no effect. This allowed for exploration of both sensory attenuation (by comparing ERPs to action-triggered versus externally triggered stimuli) and action effect prediction (by comparing actions that triggered a stimulus with those that did not)
    • It was found that cortical responses to visual action effects were reduced, manifesting as a decreased activation of frontoparietal network from 150 ms after stimulus.
    • Differences between actions with an effect and those without one were observed in lateralized motor potentials which may reflect the cortical correlates for predicting action effects.
    • Re-activation of lateralized motor activity following onset of the action effect suggests common representation across both visual & motor cortices.

The study by Dewey and Carr (2013) found that self-initiated motion is perceived as slower than equivalent but externally generated motion, but only when the motion is produced in a predictable context. This may be due to internally generated predictions produced during action. The study also found that perceived speed was influenced by an interaction between congruence and    predictability, with spatially congruent motions influencing speed judgments only when action effect contingencies were unpredictable. The results support the hypothesis that self-initiated action effects are perceived differently from effects with an external origin, suggesting that anticipating the consequences of one's actions has a particular functional significance.

This paper investigates how the brain processes sounds that are self-generated compared to sounds that are externally generated. The study found that when people produce sounds themselves, there is a stronger response in the auditory cortex of the brain compared to when they hear the same sound produced by someone else. This enhancement is stronger when the sound-producing hand is on the opposite side of the brain from the auditory cortex. The study also found that people are more sensitive to self-generated sounds, and that this effect is stronger in the ear opposite to the sound-producing hand. The results suggest that a corollary discharge sent from the motor cortex during voluntary actions enhances activity in the auditory cortex and increases perceptual sensitivity in a lateralized manner.

- figures:

The study investigated how single neurons in the auditory pathways of rats and mice respond to sequences of sounds, focusing on the aspect of predictive coding. Main findings of the study were:

1. **Prediction Error is Hierarchical**: The neural responses associated with prediction error (when the brain's prediction does not match the actual sensory input) are organized hierarchically along the auditory pathway. The prediction error signals start being detectable in subcortical regions and progressively increase as the signals ascend towards the auditory cortex.

2. **Correlation with Large-Scale Mismatch Responses**: The predictive activity of the neurons correlates with large-scale mismatch responses such as the Mismatch Negativity (MMN), which is a well-known neurological phenomenon observed when an auditory stimulus deviates from an expected pattern.

3. **Involvement of Higher-order Regions**: The study highlights the involvement of higher-order auditory regions in predictive processes, with non-lemniscal (higher-order) divisions showing greater prediction error compared to lemniscal (first-order) divisions.

4. **Influence from Prefrontal Cortices**: The study suggests that the prefrontal cortex might play a role in the generation of predictive activity, which is consistent with other human studies.

5. **Generative Mechanism at Higher Levels**: While lower levels (subcortical, first-order nuclei) seemed to be mainly sensitive to global patterns, higher levels appeared to use a generative mechanism of Bayesian inference for processing the sounds.

6. **Cross-Modal Generalization**: The study mentions that similar predictive activities have been found in other sensory modalities, suggesting a generalized predictive coding mechanism across different senses.

The significance of these findings is manifold. Firstly, they provide evidence for the predictive coding framework within the auditory processing, wherein the brain is constantly making predictions about sensory input and adjusting based on the error between prediction and actual input. Secondly, the identification of hierarchical organization of predictive coding in auditory pathways sheds light on the complexity of auditory perception and processing. Lastly, by establishing and validating rodent models for studying predictive coding and mismatch responses, the findings open avenues for further research into the cellular mechanisms of neural disorders characterized by deficits in predictive coding, such as schizophrenia. This can have important implications for translational neuroscience and the development of treatments for such disorders.

  a review of different explanations of attenuation
- figures:

This review article discusses the phenomenon of auditory N1 event-related potential (ERP) attenuation, which is often observed in self-induced or self-generated sounds. The traditional explanation is that this attenuation reflects the cancellation of auditory re-afference through internal forward modeling of predictable sensory outcomes of an action. However, the article presents two additional hypotheses:

1. The attention hypothesis posits that auditory ERP attenuation occurs due to a temporary split of attention between the action and the auditory stimulation.
2. The pre-activation hypothesis suggests that attenuation is a result of the activation of a sensory template during action initiation, which then interferes with the incoming stimulation.

The review argues that although each hypothesis explains some of the findings, none fully encompasses all the observed results. For a more comprehensive understanding, systematic investigations should consider types of actions, degree of action-effect contingency, and temporal characteristics of action-effect contingency representation-buildup and -deactivation.

The effect of self‐generated versus externally generated actions on timing, duration, and amplitude of blood oxygen level dependent response for visual feedback processing. Human Brain Mapping, 43(16), 4954-4969.
The study investigated the effect of self-generated versus externally generated actions on the timing, duration, and amplitude of the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response for visual feedback processing (Kavroulakis et al., 2022). The authors found that self-generated movements resulted in earlier and shorter BOLD responses in multiple brain structures, including visual and somatosensory cortical areas, the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and thalamus. This indicates that the efference copy-based predictive mechanisms enabled earlier processing of action feedback in self-generated movements. The results also showed that the BOLD duration was shorter in cortical and subcortical brain regions in self-generated movements, which was correlated with reduced delay detection performance. The authors concluded that the timing and duration of BOLD responses are important to predict and understand human behavior, and that their results shed new light on the cortico-cerebellar-striatal loops involved in predictive perception of the visual feedback of one's own hand movements.

    •  The study tested the hypothesis that predictive mechanisms for self-generated actions lead to early and shorter neural processing compared with externally generated movements.
    • We investigated active and passive movements using a custom-made fMRI-compatible movement device. Visual video feedback of the active and passive movements was presented in real-time or with variable delays.
    •  The reanalysis confirmed previous findings that reduced BOLD response for active compared to passive movements, indicating earlier activation in areas such as supplementary motor area, cerebellum, visual cortices, etc., when performing an action than observing it passively from outside sources.
    • This suggests that efference copy-based predictions enable quicker processing times between action & its sensory consequences leading to better understanding of how humans perceive their own actions differently from those performed by others

In the study by Schafer and Marcus (1973), the authors investigated the effect of self-administered auditory and visual stimuli on human brain responses as measured by electrocortical potentials. The results showed that self-administered auditory and visual stimuli evoked smaller amplitude and faster post-stimulus timing compared to machine-delivered stimuli. The self-stimulation effect was found to be greater for auditory than visual responses, and greater at the vertex association area than over the occipital cortex for visual responses. These findings suggest that self-stimulation alters human sensory brain responses.

The study found that the amplitude of alpha-oscillations in the visual cortex increased before the onset of a visual stimulus when the identity and onset of the stimulus were controlled by participants' motor actions. This prestimulus enhancement of alpha amplitude was paralleled by psychophysical judgments of reduced contrast for the stimulus. The findings suggest that alpha-oscillations in the visual cortex preceding self-generated visual stimulation are a likely neurophysiological signature of motor-induced sensory anticipation and mediate sensory attenuation. This is the first study to establish links between a psychophysical measure of sensory attenuation and physiological evidence of anticipatory sensory modulation during an action. (Stenner et al, 2014).
    • Participants were asked to identify the difference in brightness between two images, and their motor actions were determined when each image was presented.
    • The intensity of sensory stimuli is reduced when the observer causes them, and this phenomenon can be explained by forward models arising from motor processing.
    • Alpha oscillations in the visual cortex are enhanced before a stimulus if it was caused by participants' actions, which corresponds to judgments showing lower contrast for these stimuli.
    • Alpha oscillations likely mediate anticipatory modulation that reduces perceived intensity, potentially related to top down control mechanisms used for prioritizing or gating information.

This paper investigates the neural signature of voluntary actions and their associated sensory consequences. The authors recorded EEG data from healthy subjects while they performed self-paced button presses with their right index and middle fingers. Button-presses with one finger triggered a sound (motor+sound condition), while button-presses with the other finger did not (motor-only condition). Additionally, subjects listened to externally-generated sounds delivered in expected timings (sound-only condition).

The main results of this paper are that the readiness potential (RP) amplitude was significantly more negative in the motor+sound compared with motor-only conditions, indicating that information regarding expected auditory consequences is represented in the RP preceding voluntary action execution. This study contributes to our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying voluntary actions and their associated sensory consequences.

This paper investigates how the brain processes self-generated sounds compared to externally generated sounds. The study suggests that motor output from the supplementary motor area and left primary motor cortex is the source of signal modification in auditory cortex during perception of self-generated sounds.
- The brain processes self-generated sounds differently than externally generated sounds.
- The motor system sends a predictive signal of the expected auditory consequences of the performed action to the auditory cortex, resulting in a different neural response compared to externally generated sounds.
- Motor output from the supplementary motor area (SMA) and left primary motor cortex is the source of signal modification in auditory cortex during perception of self-generated sounds.
- Tactile feedback does not seem to play a major role in the effect of signal modification in auditory cortex during perception of self-generated sounds.

* Sharpening
*** READ Action sharpens sensory representations of expected outcomes. 4288 Yon, D., Gilbert, S. J., de Lange, F. P., & Press, C. (2018).
 [cite:@yonActionSharpensSensory2018]
In the study by Yon, Gilbert, de Lange, & Press (2018), the authors investigated the relationship between actions and sensory representations of expected outcomes. The results showed that when participants executed hand movements, visual representations of hand movements could be decoded more accurately when they were congruent with the action, leading to enhanced visual processing. The authors found that these decoding enhancements were accompanied by suppressed activity in voxels tuned away from the expected stimulus, consistent with the idea that prediction during action sharpens sensory representations. These results suggest that sensory processing during action is optimized in line with normative models of Bayesian perceptual inference. (Yon, Gilbert, de Lange, & Press, 2018).
    • The research paper discusses two models of action control: one that suggests expected sensory signals are cancelled, and another which proposes they are represented with greater fidelity (sharpened).
        ◦ “Sharpening’ models are thought to explain a range of perceptual phenomena whereby observers are biased towards perceiving stimuli that they expect, for instance, perceiving greyscale bananas to be yellow. Under these accounts it is hypothesised that activity in sensory brain areas may in principle be suppressed for expected inputs, but the suppression would not resemble that predicted by the can- cellation account. Specifically, activity should be suppressed only in units tuned away from expected inputs, rather than in units tuned towards these inputs as hypothesised by the cancellation account.”
        ◦ T”his sharpening is con- sidered to arise through competitive interactions between neural populations tuned towards and away from the expected stimulus, such that activity in unpredicted units is attenuated relative to that in predicted units (e.g., through lateral inhibition)13,17. Predictive signals thereby stop ‘gossiping’ among sensory units21 (for further discussion see ref.22)”
    • An fMRI experiment was conducted to distinguish between these models. It involved participants executing hand actions while observing movements of an avatar hand.
    •  Results showed that visual representations were classified more accurately when congruent with the action being executed, indicating sharpening rather than cancellation of expected sensory signals.
    • This supports a Bayesian model for sensorimotor prediction in which veridical perception is facilitated by sharper representation of anticipated outcomes.

* Modulation works via an effernce copy
*** Haggard, P., & Whitford, B. (2004). Supplementary motor area provides an efferent signal for sensory suppression. Brain research. Cognitive brain research, 19(1), 52–58. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cogbrainres.2003.10.018
[cite:@haggardSupplementaryMotorArea2004]
Haggard and Whiteford (2004), found evidence that the SMA may provide an efferent signal which is used by other brain areas to modulate somatosensory activity during self-generated movement. This suggests that sensory suppression in voluntary actions can be explained through motor prediction, where a signal from motor areas cancels out any predicted reafferences as a consequence of movement.

    • Voluntary actions produce suppression of neural activity in sensory areas, resulting in reduced levels of conscious sensation. This phenomenon has been linked to motor prediction: an efferent signal from motor areas may cancel out the predicted reafferences as a consequence of movement.
    • The experiments conducted with eight normal subjects showed that when they made voluntary actions, they perceived the first test MEP to be smaller than on trials where no action was taken - demonstrating sensory suppression. Additionally, delivering prepulses over SMA 10 ms before producing the test pulse almost abolished any observed effects - suggesting that an efferent signal from motor areas is used by other brain regions to modulate somatosensory activity during self-generated movements.

* Action sensory modulation is learning based

*** SKIM Roussel, C., Hughes, G., & Waszak, F. (2013). A preactivation account of sensory attenuation. Neuropsychologia, 51(5), 922-929.
[cite:@rousselPreactivationAccountSensory2013]
The article by Roussel, Hughes, and Waszak (2013) presents a new model for sensory attenuation, the phenomenon in which the intensity of action-effects is reduced when they are predictable. The authors propose that voluntary action selection involves the pre-activation of learned action-effects, and they test their predictions in a contrast discrimination task where    participants learn action-effect associations between button presses and letter stimuli. The results show a reduction in contrast discrimination sensitivity for stimuli that are congruent with the learned action-effects, and this reduction is driven by an increase in the internal response for lower contrast stimuli. This provides a novel account of how motor prediction drives sensory attenuation of action-effects. The model successfully generated testable predictions and explained the reduction in stimulus discrimination previously observed for accurately predicted action-effects.
    • Motor prediction can drive sensory attenuation of action-effects.
    • This was demonstrated through a contrast discrimination task in which participants were trained to learn associations between left and right-hand button presses and letter stimuli with different contrast levels.
    • Results showed reduced sensitivity for lower contrast stimuli congruent with these learned associations, suggesting that sensory attenuation results from the preactivation of learned actions-effects as predicted by the proposed model.

* Stronger modulation in ipsilateral configuration

* Advantage in contralateral configuration

* Sensorymotor learning is sensitive to the lateral configuration

*** READ Dery, Mukamel () Learning of Audio-motor Skill Is Sensitive to  the Lateral Relationship between Trained Hand and Ear, .
The current paper explores whether manipulating the identity of the sensor involved in an audiomotor task differentially affects sensorimotor integration compared to manipulating the effector used.
The authors trained 60 right-handed individuals over two days to perform the same finger sequence on a digital piano, but with auditory feedback presented monaurally to either the left or right ear.
Both groups showed improvements in inter-press-interval accuracy (IPI) and reduced errors over time, but the group that received auditory feedback to the right ear had more accurate IPIs, suggesting a potential right-ear advantage or contralateral relationship between the active hand and stimulated ear.
The findings suggest that sensory regions not only code the sensory consequences of the action but also the identity of the active sensor involved in the action. Previous neuroimaging and behavioral studies support these findings.
