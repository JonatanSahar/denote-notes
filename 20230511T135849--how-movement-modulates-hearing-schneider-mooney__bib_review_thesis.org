* reading notes
A possible role of motor auditory modulation are the reallocation of neural resources from processing information sources which are less reliable during movement (=auditory) to other modalities, like vision.

Since the auditory consequences of our actions are so varied, the canceling-type modulation of the auditory system must be very adaptive.
