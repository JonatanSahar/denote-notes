**** Intro
***** why is it important to study sensory-motor interactions
+ motor action is the basis for our interaction with the world
+ motor learning is basic and crucial
+ motor learning is a process of sensorimotor integration
+ sensorimotor integration requires and implies differential processing of self generated vs externally generated stimuli
+ this has been suggested and shown to rely on interactions between the motor system and the various sensory systems.

Motor action is arguably at the basis of all of our interactions with the world: moving through our environment, manipulating it, speaking and even our directing our gaze to take in our surroundings. Motor learning, is therefore an essential process, basic to our existence and our experience as leaving things. Motor learning it turn is a process of sensorimotor integration - the ability of the CNS to match synchronize our actions and their perceived sensory consequences.
The current understanding is/research over the past couple of decades suggests that the motor system and the various sensory systems are closely intertwined: it's been suggested that motor cortex activation is paramount in our understanding of observed action via the mirror neurons system,
TODO: complete.

There are findings showing both attenuation and enhancement (TODO: add citations), this study hope to add to our understanding of why that is so.

***** why is it important to study laterality?
+ the motor and auditory systems are both lateralized, so laterality may make a difference
+ structural effects of shorter neural path between areas in the same hemisphere
+ better integration of learned audio-motor associations due to information passing through more regions when traveling between hemispheres

Both the motor and the auditory and visual systems in the human brain are lateralized; i.e. they predominantly operate in one hemisphere. Stemming from this fact is the potentially pivotal role that laterality, i.e. the lateral relationship between (motor) affector and (sensory) effector may play in the interaction and integration between these systems. On the one hand, the structural advantages afforded by the shorter neural pathways between regions within the same hemisphere may facilitate more efficient communication and coordination between auditory and motor processing in the ipsilateral condition, an advantage which is particularly pertinent when considering the speed and precision required in audiomotor tasks such as playing a musical instrument. On the other hand, information which traverses between hemispheres, travels through a greater number of interconnected regions, which may contribute to enhanced integration of learned audio-motor associations. This kind of inter-hemispheric communication could be essential for complex tasks that require the coordination of sensory and motor information. Additionally, the study of hand-ear laterality can significantly contribute to our knowledge of hemispheric lateralization, which is a fundamental aspect of brain function and cognitive processing.  In an applied context, these insights could have implications for developing interventions and training protocols aimed at improving audio-motor performance, and potentially even for the development of strategies for rehabilitation in cases of brain injury or degenerative diseases.

    * predictive coding had long emerged as the predominant principle governing the workings of the brain: the constant prediction of incoming stimuli, internal and external, based on the brain's learned statistical model of the world, the current multidimensional state of the brain and the environment, and the constant comparison of those predictions to actual incoming stimuli - generating prediction errors, which are used to update either the brain's model, its estimation of the current state of the environment, or both.
    * neural sharpening is the enhancement of the veridical perception of stimuli brought about by the narrowing of individual neurons' tuning curves (or receptive fields). According to [cite:@yonActionSharpensSensory218]] motor action may modulate perception and processing, at least in part, through this process of sharpening. While [cite:@reznikMotorOutputNeural2019] suggest that specifically in the auditory domain sharpening is achieved through the attenuation of auditory cortex pyramidal cells by inhibitory interneurons which receive input from the motor cortex.

The relationship between the motor and different sensory systems has been the subject of extensive research. Central to this relationship is the conception that the motor system is not an isolated entity, but rather it is both highly intertwined with the different sensory modalities and profoundly involved in our semantic understanding of the world TODO: citations. The theoretical background for the modulation of sensory processing and perception by the motor system is based on the idea that the motor system is not only responsible for generating movements, but also contributes to the predictions of the sensory consequences of those movements. This predictive ability allows the motor cortex to modulate sensory processing and perception in real time, enhancing the relevance of sensory information and shaping perception.

One framework that has been proposed for understanding the modulation of sensory processing and perception by the motor system is the Theory of Event Coding (TEC). TEC posits that perceptual and motor plans and their associated precepts are stored in a common representational format (event codes), and that the interaction between these representations allows for the formation of event files, representing events that involve both motor and sensory aspects, integrating information across different modalities and time. By encoding sensory and motor information in a common format, the brain can more easily integrate information to guide perception and action.

Another theoretical framework that has been proposed for understanding the modulation of sensory processing and perception by the motor system is Predictive Coding. Predictive coding proposes that the brain processes sensory information by generating predictions based on prior knowledge and experience, and then comparing those predictions with incoming sensory signals to update its internal model of the world. In the context of auditory processing and the motor cortex, predictive coding may play an important role in the modulation of auditory processing and perception by allowing the motor cortex to generate predictions about the sensory consequences of an action that bias incoming sensory input toward expected patterns.

In addition, research has shown that the modulation of sensory processing and perception by the motor system is not always straightforward, and can depend on a variety of factors including the complexity of the task, attentional demands, and the relevance of the sensory information for guiding movements. However, despite the complexity of the auditory-motor interaction, the theoretical background for this phenomenon provides a framework for understanding how the motor system interacts with the auditory system to shape perception and action.
---------------------------------------------
The interaction between the motor system and sensory processing is underpinned by a deeply interconnected neural network that facilitates the integration of sensory information and motor commands. Central to this relationship is the conception that the motor system is not an isolated entity solely responsible for generating movement, but rather, it is profoundly involved in the semantic representation of actions. This includes both actions that are being planned as well as those that are being perceived.

One mechanism thought to facilitate this integration is the presence of mirror neurons. These specialized neurons fire both when an individual performs an action and when the individual observes the same action being performed by another. Mirror neurons are believed to be central to our ability to understand and interpret the actions of others, as they provide a bridge between perception and action within our own neural circuitry.

A significant theoretical framework that addresses the intricate interplay between perception and action is the Theory of Event Coding (TEC). It posits that there is a shared neural representation for action plans and the sensory consequences of these actions. According to TEC, this common coding allows the brain to efficiently integrate sensory and motor information, which is essential for coherent perception and skilled action. This shared representation is dynamic and is influenced by both the current environmental context and the goals of the individual.

Further elaborating on the relationship between sensory prediction and motor command is the Forward Model. The Forward Model suggests that when a motor command is issued, an “efference copy” of this command is sent to sensory regions of the brain. This efference copy essentially serves as a prediction of the sensory consequences of the action. By comparing the predicted sensory feedback with the actual sensory input, the brain can distinguish between self-generated stimuli and stimuli that originate from the external environment.

Embedded within this model is the concept of predictive coding, which posits that the brain is essentially a predictive machine. The brain continuously generates predictions of incoming sensory information based on a statistical model that has been learned over time. These predictions are generated in a hierarchical manner, and discrepancies between predictions and actual sensory input produce prediction errors. These prediction errors are then used to update the brain's model and to fine-tune perception and action.

In this interplay between prediction and perception, neural sharpening is a noteworthy mechanism. It refers to the enhancement of perception through the narrowing of the receptive fields or tuning curves of individual neurons. The process increases the distinctiveness of neural responses to relevant sensory stimuli. Studies cited as [cite:@yonActionSharpensSensory218] indicate that motor action may modulate sensory processing, partly through neural sharpening. Moreover, research cited as [cite:@reznikMotorOutputNeural2019] suggests that in the auditory domain, this sharpening is achieved through the attenuation of auditory cortex pyramidal cells by inhibitory interneurons that receive input from the motor cortex. This indicates that the motor cortex has a direct influence on the processing in the auditory cortex, possibly optimizing it for relevant auditory stimuli.

In summary, the modulation of sensory processing and perception by the motor system is a multifaceted and dynamic process involving several intertwined theoretical frameworks. Through mechanisms such as the activation of mirror neurons, the formation of event codes in TEC, the efference copy in the Forward Model, and neural sharpening, the motor system is intrinsically involved in shaping our perception of the world and our interactions with it.

**** IV. Conclusion

* Methods
** Subjects
Thirty-three participants were recruited, all of them healthy, right handed (self-reported, Edinburgh Handedness Inventory),
and had normal or corrected to normal vision.
The study conformed to the guidelines that were approved by the ethical committee in Tel-Aviv University and the Helsinki Committee of the Sheba Medical Center. All participants provided written informed consent to participate in the study and were compensated for their time.
** fMRI Session
The aim of this session was to examine whether neural activations in auditory cortex, evoked by action-triggered auditory consequences, depend on the stimulus-triggering hand. To this end, participants triggered identical visual stimuli using either their right or left hand.

The fMRI session included one anatomical run and a total of eight functional runs: two motor-only runs, two auditory-only runs, and four audiomotor experimental runs.
Auditory-only runs were meant for localizing the auditory pathway, motor-only runs were meant for localizing the motor cortex and to examine the a-priory modulating effect of the motor cortex on the auditory system (i.e. In the absence of auditory stimuli), and the audiomotor runs were designed to examine the differential effect of triggering auditory stimuli using the right versus the left hand per ear (i.e. activating the sound with the contralateral vs ipsilateral hand with regards to the ear).

All functional runs were organized in a block design, and all consisted of 20 blocks with an 8s rest period before the first block and between each consecutive block pair. During the rest period participants were requested to fixate on a black cross in the middle of the screen, and block onset was cued by the cross' color changing to green. Before the color changed, either the letter "R" or the letter "L" were displayed for 1s, replacing the cross.
In the motor-only and the audiomotor conditions the appearance of the green cross was the cue for the participants to initiate a set of eight button presses with either their left or right thumbs, as indicated by the presented letter. Once eight button presses were completed, the screen's background flashed green as an indication to stop pressing. In the audiomotor condition each button press triggered a single monaural tone of a fixed 400ms duration, while in the motor-only condition button presses were unaccompanied by sound. In the auditory-only condition, participants were instructed to listen without pressing, while eight tones (identical to the ones in the audiomotor condition) were played to either their left or right ears, again terminating with the screen flashing green.

Participants always underwent the motor-only condition first, and the auditory-only condition second, in order to avoid creating an association between the motor action and its consequences that would affect brain activation during motor-only runs.

The order of right and left hand blocks in the motor-only and audiomotor conditions, and of right and left ear blocks in the auditory-only condition were randomized.
Within each audiomotor run the stimulated ear was kept constant while the active hand changed between blocks.
There were a total of 20 blocks per hand in the motor-only condition, and 20 blocks per ear in the auditory-only condition. In the audiomotor condition there were two runs per ear, totaling 40 blocks per ear, and 20 blocks per hand-ear combination.

Stimuli were presented on a 32" monitor and viewed by the participants through a mirror placed on the MRI head coil.

 In order to keep participants attentive, in case the wrong hand was used the screen flashed red, and they were requested to pay more attention at the end of the run.
 Blocks in which the wrong hand was used, or not all eight button presses were performed, or too many button presses were performed were excluded from the analysis.

** fMRI Data Acquisition TODO: verify pulse sequence parameters
 Functional imaging was performed on a Siemens Magnetom Prisma 3T Scanner (Siemens Healthcare)with a 64-channel head coil at the Tel-Aviv University Strauss Center for Computational Neuroimaging. In all functional scans, an interleaved multiband gradient-echo echo-planar pulse sequence was used. 66 slices were acquired for each volume, providing whole-brain coverage (slice thickness 2 mm; voxel size 2 mm isotropic; TR = 1000 ms; TE = 30 ms; flip angle = 82. ; field of view= 192 mm; acceleration factor = 2). For anatomical reference, a whole-brain high resolution T1-weighted scan (slice thickness 1 mm; voxel size 1 mm isotropic; TR = 1000 ms; TE = 2. 99 ms; flip angle = 7. ; field of view= 224 mm) was acquired for each participant.
