This review article focuses on the sensory processing of action effects and how it differs from the processing of externally triggered stimuli. The article discusses intentional binding and sensory attenuation and their attribution to forward action models. The review systematically investigates the role of temporal prediction, temporal control, identity prediction, and motor prediction in previous reports of sensory attenuation and intentional binding. The authors propose avenues for future research to better understand the role of motor prediction in processing voluntary action effects and how these phenomena fit within a general predictive processing framework. The article also highlights the implications of this research for understanding disorders of agency in schizophrenia.

  A physiological basis for efference copy in mice
- figures:

This paper investigates how motor-related signals from the motor cortex influence auditory cortical activity in mice, and the synaptic and circuit mechanisms underlying this interplay. The research findings suggest that a subset of neurons in the secondary motor cortex that innervate the auditory cortex and are active during movement drive motor-related changes in auditory cortical dynamics, likely facilitating hearing and auditory-guided behaviors. The study used in vivo intracellular recordings and optogenetics in mice.

  Discusses and compares different possible perceptual modulations/effects that can arise from efferece copies in the auditory domain

[[file:_20230404_141537_YIy4D7.png]]

This paper is about how performing voluntary actions with sensory consequences can modify physiological and behavioral responses relative to passive experiences of the same sensory input, and how these modifications are mediated by efference copies sent from motor cortex to sensory regions. The paper specifically focuses on examining the type of perceptual modification (enhancement vs. attenuation) reported by healthy human subjects when manipulating the intensity of self-generated and externally-generated sounds in the auditory domain. The study found that the intensity of self-generated sounds can lead to both perceived loudness enhancement and attenuation, depending on the specific sensory context of the voluntary actions.

  Right/left key presses, responses to self vs external auditory stimuli, affector specific responses ni auditory cortex
- figures:

The study examined how the brain responds to predicted action's effects and their omissions, specifically in relation to effector-specific and effector-unspecific predictions. Participants pressed left and right keys to generate predictable or unpredictable tones, and the data showed that omissions following hand-specific associations reliably elicited a late omission N1 (oN1) component. Additionally, when both key-presses generated the same tone, rare omissions of the expected tone generated both early and late oN1 responses, while when two simultaneous action-effect representations had to be maintained, only late oN1 responses were elicited.
The study highlights the top-down effects of action intention on the sensory processing of omissions, with unspecific and multiple action-effect representations associated with processing costs at the early sensory levels. Omission P3 (oP3) responses were strongly elicited for all omission types without differences, indicating a general expectation  based on tone presentation rather than which tone.

This study investigates how predictions affect perception by measuring the brain's response to the omission of a predicted auditory stimulus. The authors replicated a previous study and found that specific predictions about the identity of the upcoming stimulus are necessary to observe an omission response in the brain. They also found evidence for both specific and unspecific predictions along the sound processing hierarchy, suggesting that

The study explores the neural mechanisms that allow us to distinguish sounds that arise from our movements from those that come from the environment. They used mice in an acoustic virtual reality setting to identify the neural circuits responsible for suppressing movement-related sounds and the behavioral consequences of this experience. The findings suggest that motor cortical inputs to the auditory cortex shape a sensory filter that can suppress predictable acoustic consequences of movement and enhance auditory discrimination during movement.

  This paper discusses a study that explores the neural responses in the auditory cortex of mice to self-generated sounds and the accuracy of predicting both sensory features and timing of self-generated stimuli, as well as identifying distinct populations of auditory cortical neurons with movement, expectation, and error signals consistent with a learned internal model linking an action to its specific acoustic outcome.

  A theoretical discussion of the effect of expectation on perception (visual)
- figures:

The article discusses how expectations based on structure in sensory signals facilitate decision-making in visual perception, and explores the ways in which expectations modulate neural signals and behavior in humans and primates. It considers how expectations bias visual activity and how neural signals differ between expected and unexpected stimuli. The article also discusses how expectations may influence decision signals and their relationship with attention and adaptation.

- figures:

The study investigated the time course of action effect anticipation in voluntary action control. Participants learned specific visual effects associated with left and right key-presses and performed a motion discrimination task in which congruent and incongruent dot motion was presented before or after action execution. Higher sensitivity to motion discrimination was observed in congruent trials when stimuli were presented from 220 ms before the action to 280 ms after the action, suggesting that action-effect prediction modulates perception at later stages of motor preparation.

  It shows neural evidence supporting efference copy to the somatosensory cortex.
- figures:

The study provides empirical evidence for efference-copy models of motor control by showing that signals in Brodmann Area 2 (BA2) can reflect input from motor cortices. The study also suggests that interpreting activations in BA2 as evidence for somatosensory-motor rather than somatosensory coding alone would be more appropriate. Additionally, the study found that brain activity in cortical structures associated with motor control predicted brain activity in BA2 without being entirely mediated by activity in early somatosensory cortex.

  Shows evidence that sensory modulation (attenuation) _is_ related to self-generation of actions and not just to predictability/surprise.

Relates to [cite:@satoActionObservationModulates2008].
The perception of sensory effects generated by one's own actions is typically reduced compared to those generated by external sources, but it is unclear if this is unique to self-generated actions. Recent research suggests that the reduction in perception is due to action preparation, rather than actual execution, so this effect may also occur for anticipated actions of others. However, a study comparing the perceived loudness of self-generated sounds and sounds generated by others found that the attenuation effect was unique to self-generation and not affected by anticipation of others' actions.

Transcallosal fibers connecting the same muscles in the left and right primary motor cortex may help control unilateral movements by mainly inhibiting their activity. This was tested with transcranial magnetic stimulation using focal coils on the optimal positions of the first dorsal interosseous muscle on both sides.
