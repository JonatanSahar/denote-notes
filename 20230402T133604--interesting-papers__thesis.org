The study found that movement planning influences early sensory areas in the brain. Using fMRI, they showed that specific movement information can be decoded from neural activity in the early auditory cortex before the movement happens. This motor-related information is separate from sensory-related information and is present even when movements are visually cued. The findings suggest that action planning involves modulating sensory areas based on the intended action.

This paper investigates how motor-related signals from the motor cortex influence auditory cortical activity in mice, and the synaptic and circuit mechanisms underlying this interplay. The research findings suggest that a subset of neurons in the secondary motor cortex that innervate the auditory cortex and are active during movement drive motor-related changes in auditory cortical dynamics, likely facilitating hearing and auditory-guided behaviors. The study used in vivo intracellular recordings and optogenetics in mice.

- figures
  This paper reports the first direct evidence for efferent signals in sensory cortex that are evoked by voluntary actions coupled with sensory consequences. The authors show that motor-related evoked-responses in auditory cortex precede and correspond with subsequent sound detection, suggesting their functional relevance to auditory processing. This study is important because it sheds light on the neural mechanisms underlying the modulation of sensory perception by voluntary actions and expected sensory consequences.

- figures:
[[file:_20230404_141537_YIy4D7.png]]

This paper is about how performing voluntary actions with sensory consequences can modify physiological and behavioral responses relative to passive experiences of the same sensory input, and how these modifications are mediated by efference copies sent from motor cortex to sensory regions. The paper specifically focuses on examining the type of perceptual modification (enhancement vs. attenuation) reported by healthy human subjects when manipulating the intensity of self-generated and externally-generated sounds in the auditory domain. The study found that the intensity of self-generated sounds can lead to both perceived loudness enhancement and attenuation, depending on the specific sensory context of the voluntary actions.

  Right/left key presses, responses to self vs external auditory stimuli, affector specific responses ni auditory cortex
- figures:

The study examined how the brain responds to predicted action's effects and their omissions, specifically in relation to effector-specific and effector-unspecific predictions. Participants pressed left and right keys to generate predictable or unpredictable tones, and the data showed that omissions following hand-specific associations reliably elicited a late omission N1 (oN1) component. Additionally, when both key-presses generated the same tone, rare omissions of the expected tone generated both early and late oN1 responses, while when two simultaneous action-effect representations had to be maintained, only late oN1 responses were elicited.
The study highlights the top-down effects of action intention on the sensory processing of omissions, with unspecific and multiple action-effect representations associated with processing costs at the early sensory levels. Omission P3 (oP3) responses were strongly elicited for all omission types without differences, indicating a general expectation  based on tone presentation rather than which tone.

This study investigates how predictions affect perception by measuring the brain's response to the omission of a predicted auditory stimulus. The authors replicated a previous study and found that specific predictions about the identity of the upcoming stimulus are necessary to observe an omission response in the brain. They also found evidence for both specific and unspecific predictions along the sound processing hierarchy, suggesting that

  Evidence for auditory suppression of walking sounds in mice, VR

The study explores the neural mechanisms that allow us to distinguish sounds that arise from our movements from those that come from the environment. They used mice in an acoustic virtual reality setting to identify the neural circuits responsible for suppressing movement-related sounds and the behavioral consequences of this experience. The findings suggest that motor cortical inputs to the auditory cortex shape a sensory filter that can suppress predictable acoustic consequences of movement and enhance auditory discrimination during movement.

The article discusses how expectations based on structure in sensory signals facilitate decision-making in visual perception, and explores the ways in which expectations modulate neural signals and behavior in humans and primates. It considers how expectations bias visual activity and how neural signals differ between expected and unexpected stimuli. The article also discusses how expectations may influence decision signals and their relationship with attention and adaptation.

- figures:

The study investigated the time course of action effect anticipation in voluntary action control. Participants learned specific visual effects associated with left and right key-presses and performed a motion discrimination task in which congruent and incongruent dot motion was presented before or after action execution. Higher sensitivity to motion discrimination was observed in congruent trials when stimuli were presented from 220 ms before the action to 280 ms after the action, suggesting that action-effect prediction modulates perception at later stages of motor preparation.

  It shows neural evidence supporting efference copy to the somatosensory cortex.
- figures:

The study provides empirical evidence for efference-copy models of motor control by showing that signals in Brodmann Area 2 (BA2) can reflect input from motor cortices. The study also suggests that interpreting activations in BA2 as evidence for somatosensory-motor rather than somatosensory coding alone would be more appropriate. Additionally, the study found that brain activity in cortical structures associated with motor control predicted brain activity in BA2 without being entirely mediated by activity in early somatosensory cortex.

  Shows evidence that sensory modulation (attenuation) _is_ related to self-generation of actions and not just to predictability/surprise.
- figures:
Relates to [cite:@satoActionObservationModulates2008].
The perception of sensory effects generated by one's own actions is typically reduced compared to those generated by external sources, but it is unclear if this is unique to self-generated actions. Recent research suggests that the reduction in perception is due to action preparation, rather than actual execution, so this effect may also occur for anticipated actions of others. However, a study comparing the perceived loudness of self-generated sounds and sounds generated by others found that the attenuation effect was unique to self-generation and not affected by anticipation of others' actions.

  evidence of auditory modulation being predictive, like the reznik paper
- figures:

The paper discusses sensory attenuation, or the perception of self-generated actions as less intense than identical, externally generated stimuli. The study found evidence for a predictive modulation in sensory cortex that is independent of general expectations, attention, and task load. This modulation was found through motor priming, which enhances subjective experience of agency and leads to stronger sensory attenuation and a transient signal in auditory cortex before stimulus onset. The findings support the idea of a sensory modulation prior to self-generated sensations and parallel to motor output.

  auditory modulation in relation with sense of agency
- figures:

The brain shows less response to self-generated sounds compared to externally generated ones, possibly due to a mechanism that distinguishes the sensory consequence of one's own actions from other sensory input. However, it is unclear how this sensory suppression is related to judgments of agency. Results from the study suggest that N1 amplitude suppression to self-generated sounds is not affected by the timing of an action's effect, and does not influence agency judgments, but the suppression of the P2 component may be more directly related to the experience of agency.
