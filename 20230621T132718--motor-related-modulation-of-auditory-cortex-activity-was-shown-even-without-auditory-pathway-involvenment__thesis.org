[cite:@attenuation_rummell_2016] fount that, in mice, there was an attenuation of auditory cortex activation caused by optogenetic activation of auditory thalamocortical connection - so completely bypassing the path from the ear to the thalamus! - supporting the idea that this attenuation is a top-down, cortical, affair.
