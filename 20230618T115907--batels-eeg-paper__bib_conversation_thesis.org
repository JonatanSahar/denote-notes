There are two conditions that evolve over time, we're sort of looking at four conditions really:
- visual cue beginning
- visual cue end
- motor action beginning
- motor action end

  In the beginning there is little-to-no expectation/prediction in both conditions, and in the end there should be perfect prediction.
The main point is that the difference between the motor and visual conditions in the end, is the same at the difference between them at the beginning: this means that there is an added value for motor activation over and above the effect of expectation.
They term it "agency", which I think means something a little different, but at any rate - it shows a modulation effect of our own actions on perception which is different than (merely) making the incoming stimuli more predictable.
