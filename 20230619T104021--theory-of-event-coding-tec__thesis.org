The Theory of Event Coding (TEC) proposes that perceptual and motor representations are stored in a common representational format, and that the interaction between these representations allows for the formation of event codes that integrate information across different modalities and time.
This framework is particularly relevant in the context of the modulation of auditory processing by the motor cortex because it suggests that the motor system can influence auditory processing and perception by generating event codes that integrate information about both the motor and auditory aspects of an action.
By encoding these representations in a common format, the brain may be able to more easily integrate information across different modalities and time, which can enhance perception and action.
In addition, TEC proposes that event codes are not fixed, but are dynamically constructed and updated based on the current context and goals, which may allow for flexible modulation of auditory processing and perception based on the demands of the task.

Event codes and event files in the context of Theory of Event Coding (TEC) refer to the neural representations of perceptual and motor events that share a common representational format. An event file is a temporary binding of these event codes, creating a single representation of an event that involves both motor and sensory aspects. This integration of motor and sensory information enables the brain to form complete representations of events and to use this information to guide perception and action. Event codes and files are not fixed but are dynamic and updated based on the task demands and the current context, allowing for flexible modulation of sensory processing and perception. Overall, the concept of event codes and event files in TEC provides a framework for understanding the integration of motor and sensory information in perception and action.
